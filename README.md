# Krizic - Kruzic [ Terminal igra ]

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game "Krizic - Kruzic" (Tic-Tac-Toe) in Python. The game allows two players to take turns and place their symbols ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

Run the Python script in your terminal or command prompt.
The board will be displayed, and each cell will be represented by a number from 1 to 9.
Players take turns choosing a number corresponding to the cell they want to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') in.
The game will continue until one player wins or there is a draw.
Board Representation
The board is represented by a list named board_list, where each element corresponds to a cell on the board. An empty cell is denoted by a space character (' ').

## How to Make a Move

To make a move, enter the number of the cell where you want to place your symbol when prompted.

## Winning Conditions

The game checks after each move if any player has won the game. A player wins if they have three of their symbols ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Restarting the Game

After the game ends (either due to a win or a draw), you will be asked if you want to play again. Type "D" for "Da" (Yes) or "N" for "Ne" (No) and press Enter.
